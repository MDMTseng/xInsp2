# Instance model

How xInsp2 represents and manages plugin instances. Read this if
you're building a feature that touches `cmd:create_instance` /
`open_project` / `instance.json`, or if you're trying to figure out
where a piece of state lives.

---

## Plugin vs instance

- A **plugin** is a type — a DLL exposing the C ABI, registered once
  per backend startup (or rescan). Examples: `mock_camera`,
  `blob_analysis`.
- An **instance** is a configured use of a plugin in a project — it
  has a unique name, persisted JSON config, an on-disk folder, and a
  proxy object the script can call via `xi::use("name")`. Example:
  `cam0` (an instance of `mock_camera`).

A project can have many instances of the same plugin; each gets its
own folder, config, and identity.

## On-disk layout

```
<project>/
├── project.json
│   {
│     "name": "...",
│     "script": "inspection.cpp",
│     "auto_respawn": true,
│     "watchdog_ms": 10000,
│     "trigger_policy": { ... }
│   }
├── inspection.cpp
└── instances/
    ├── cam0/
    │   ├── instance.json     ← { "plugin": "mock_camera",
    │   │                          "isolation": "process"?,
    │   │                          "config": { ... } }
    │   └── (whatever the plugin chose to write here)
    └── det0/
        └── instance.json
```

`<project>/instances/<name>/` is **per-instance scratch space**. The
plugin's `host->instance_folder("cam0")` returns this path; the
plugin can write calibration files, ML weights, captured frames,
anything bigger than `instance.json`'s small config blob.

---

## Lifecycle

### `cmd:open_project`

1. Backend reads `project.json` → applies trigger policy, autorespawn,
   watchdog.
2. Backend scans `instances/` subdirectories.
3. For each subdirectory:
   - Read `instance.json`. Field `plugin` names the type.
   - Look up the plugin in the registered set (scanned earlier from
     `plugins_dir` + extra dirs).
   - If `instance.json` has `"isolation": "process"` AND the worker env
     is configured, build a `ProcessInstanceAdapter` (plugin runs in
     `xinsp-worker.exe`, method calls go over IPC, pixel data via SHM).
     Falls back to in-proc with a warning if the worker env is missing.
   - Otherwise (default): in-proc — `xi_plugin_create(host_api, instance_name)`.
   - Apply persisted `config` via `xi_plugin_set_def`.
   - Register in `InstanceRegistry`.
4. **Skip-bad-instance**: any failure (broken JSON, missing plugin,
   factory throws) records an `OpenWarning` and continues. The
   project still opens with the survivors.

The list of skipped instances is surfaced as a `warn` log; the user
can read it via `cmd:open_project_warnings` and decide whether to fix
or delete the bad folder.

### `cmd:create_instance`

Adds a new instance to a running project:
1. Validates name (uniqueness, not empty).
2. Creates `<project>/instances/<name>/`.
3. Calls `xi_plugin_create(host_api, name)` (this is when the plugin
   first sees its instance name).
4. Writes initial `instance.json` with the plugin's `get_def()`
   output.
5. Registers in `InstanceRegistry`.

### `cmd:save_project`

For every instance in the registry: call `get_def()`, write
`instances/<name>/instance.json`. Atomic write via
`xi_atomic_io.hpp` so a crash mid-save can't corrupt config.

### `cmd:remove_instance`

1. Remove from `InstanceRegistry` (script's `xi::use(...)` proxies
   start returning errors).
2. Call `xi_plugin_destroy`.
3. **Default: keep the folder on disk.** The user can recreate the
   instance with the same name and pick up where they left off. Pass
   the `--purge` flag (or click "Delete folder too" in the UI) to
   wipe.

### `cmd:close_project`

Tear down all instances (call `xi_plugin_destroy` on each), clear the
registry. Plugin DLLs stay loaded; only instance objects go.

The trigger bus is reset; recording is stopped.

### Backend shutdown

Dtors run in `~PluginManager`: `FreeLibrary` every loaded plugin DLL
explicitly. Cleaner than letting the OS reap them — surfaces leaks
under detection tools.

---

## Instance registry

`backend/include/xi/xi_instance.hpp` — the global
`xi::InstanceRegistry`.

```cpp
auto& reg = xi::InstanceRegistry::instance();
auto inst = reg.find("cam0");                // shared_ptr<InstanceBase>
auto all  = reg.list();                      // vector
reg.add(my_instance);
reg.remove("cam0");
```

Instances are stored as `shared_ptr<InstanceBase>`; the script
proxy (`xi::use<T>("...")`) takes a copy so it survives even if a
hot-reload or close-project happens mid-call.

`InstanceBase` is a simple polymorphic interface:

```cpp
class InstanceBase {
public:
    virtual ~InstanceBase() = default;
    virtual const std::string& name() const = 0;
    virtual std::string        plugin_name() const = 0;
    virtual std::string        get_def() const             { return "{}"; }
    virtual bool               set_def(const std::string&) { return true; }
    virtual std::string        exchange(const std::string& cmd) { return "{}"; }
};
```

Two adapters wrap the C ABI:
- `CAbiInstanceAdapter` — same-process: holds the `void*` instance
  pointer and the function pointers resolved from the DLL.
- `ProcessInstanceAdapter` — cross-process (spike branch): proxies
  every call over a named pipe to a `xinsp-worker.exe` instance,
  with auto-respawn + per-call timeout.

---

## isolation modes

**Default: process.** A new instance with no `isolation` field in its
`instance.json` runs in its own `xinsp-worker.exe`. Method calls
(`set_def` / `exchange` / `get_def` / `process`) proxy over a named
pipe, pixel data shares zero-copy via SHM.

Crash recovery is two-layered:

1. **In-worker SEH catch.** The worker process wraps every `process()`
   call in `_set_se_translator`. An access violation / null deref /
   divide-by-zero / similar SEH inside the plugin is caught and
   replied to over the pipe as a per-call error — the worker process
   keeps running, the next call goes straight through, no IPC
   re-handshake. Backend logs `[xinsp2] use_process('<name>')
   isolated: plugin crashed: <reason>`; the script side gets a Record
   with `error` set to the same string.

2. **Process-level respawn.** If something kills the worker process
   itself (an async `std::abort`, the OS OOM-killer, the SEH wrapper
   itself faulting), `ProcessInstanceAdapter` re-spawns a fresh
   worker (rate-limited 3 per 60 s) and replays the last `set_def`
   so the new worker has the same state. After 3 respawns inside the
   window the adapter gives up: `is_dead()` returns true, future
   calls error out, and a one-shot `event:isolation_dead` is emitted
   to clients.

In normal use (sane plugins, occasional bugs caught during
development) layer 1 handles everything and you never see the
respawn path fire.

If the backend was started without an isolation environment (no
`xinsp-worker.exe` next to it, or SHM region creation failed) every
default-isolated instance falls back to in-proc with one warning per
project open.

**Opt out with `"isolation": "in_process"`** (or `"none"`) when you
want the plugin to share the backend's address space — typically:

- you're actively debugging a plugin and want a single stack to step
  through,
- the per-call IPC latency matters (ns-scale function calls instead of
  µs-scale named-pipe round trips), or
- the plugin needs to share statics with backend / other plugins
  (uncommon by design — a plugin is supposed to be a self-contained
  function with its own UI config).

The legacy value `"isolation": "process"` keeps working as an explicit
declaration of the default.

```json
{
  "plugin": "shape_match",
  "isolation": "in_process",
  "call_timeout_ms": 60000,
  "config": { ... }
}
```

`call_timeout_ms` (optional, isolated instances only) bounds how long
a single IPC call (`process` / `exchange` / `set_def` / `get_def`)
may block before the adapter cancels it via `CancelIoEx` and treats
the worker as crashed. Default 30 s — bump it for plugins with slow
operations (long-exposure cameras, heavy ML inference, big template
matches) so the watchdog doesn't trip during normal work.

Worker-side conveniences (so plugin authors don't need to know which
mode they're running in):

- `xi::Plugin::pool_image(w, h, c)` (and the `xi::Image::create_in_pool`
  it wraps) automatically allocates from the SHM region in the worker
  process, so cv:: writes land directly in shared memory and the
  cross-ABI return is `addref`-only — no heap-to-shm copy at the
  boundary.
- Plugins that still allocate output via the legacy `xi::Image{w,h,c}`
  ctor (heap) get their pixels auto-promoted to SHM by `worker_main`
  before the reply.
- The output image's key (`record.image("mask", img)` → `"mask"`) is
  preserved across the IPC boundary, so scripts calling
  `record.get_image("mask")` work the same in-proc and isolated.

### `instance.json` schema

Recognised top-level keys (anything else is ignored, no error):

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `plugin` | string | yes | Name of the plugin this instance is bound to. |
| `config` | object | no | Passed verbatim to `Plugin::set_def(json)` after construction. |
| `isolation` | string | no | `"process"` (default) / `"in_process"` (opt out) / `"none"` (alias for `in_process`). |
| `call_timeout_ms` | int | no | Per-call IPC timeout for isolated instances, in ms. |

`config` is **not** required to be the same shape as `Plugin::get_def()`'s
return. Plugins commonly include read-only telemetry in `get_def()`
(`frames_processed`, `last_count`, etc.) that has no place in the
seeded `instance.json` config — `set_def()` just ignores keys it
doesn't recognise. Treat `config` as "fields the user may want to set
at project-create time"; treat `get_def()` as "everything the UI panel
needs to render the live state".

**Validation against the plugin manifest.** On `cmd:open_project` the
backend cross-checks each `config` key against the plugin's declared
`manifest.params` (if any) and surfaces typos / type errors / out-of-
range values as entries in `cmd:open_project_warnings`. Validation
never blocks load — bad keys still fall through to `set_def`, which
defaults silently. See `docs/reference/plugin-abi.md` "Plugin
manifest" for the four warning kinds (`unknown_config_key`,
`type_mismatch`, `out_of_range`, `not_in_enum`). Plugins without a
`manifest.params` block skip validation entirely.

A spawned `xinsp-worker.exe`:
- Attaches the backend's SHM region (so image handles dereference to
  the same physical pages → zero-copy `process()`).
- Loads the plugin DLL on its side.
- Services RPC over a named pipe.
- An SEH inside `process()` is caught by the worker's own translator
  and replied to as a per-call error (worker process stays up).
- Only if the worker process itself dies (OOM kill, async std::abort,
  SEH wrapper itself faulting) does the adapter respawn it (rate-
  limited 3/60s, last `set_def` replayed).
- A hung `process()` is bounded by the per-call timeout
  (default 30s) → `CancelIoEx` watchdog → forced respawn.

The isolation choice is per-instance, not per-project — you can mix
isolated and in-proc instances in the same project. Useful for
sandboxing one suspect / third-party plugin without paying RPC
overhead on the rest.

## Trigger bus + instances

Sources publish frames via `host->emit_trigger`. Each instance of an
`xi::ImageSource` plugin gets a TriggerBridge that routes its emits
into the bus tagged by the instance's name (the `source_name`
parameter of `emit_trigger`).

The project's trigger policy decides when frames correlate:
- `Any` — every emit fires one inspect.
- `AllRequired` — wait for emits from every named source under the
  same `tid`, then fire one inspect.
- `LeaderFollowers` — wait for the leader; attach the most recent
  followers; fire on leader's emit.

Configured in `project.json: trigger_policy`. Instances don't know or
care about policy — they just emit; the bus does the rest.
